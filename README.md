3.75 MW Bundled Wind Power Project by GARL, Gujarat

Title: 3.75 MW Bundled Wind Power Project by GARL, Gujarat

Date of MR: 23/10/2023

UCR ID: 374

UCR MR Period: 01

1st CoU Issuance Period: 01/01/2013 to 31/12/2022 (10 years 00 months 00 days)

1st Monitoring Period: 01/01/2013 to 31/12/2022 (10 years 00 months 00 days)
_______________
The project activity employs three (3) wind turbine generators (WTGs) of Suzlon make with each
having a capacity of 1250 kWh (total 3.75 MWh installed capacity) by M/s Gokul Agro
Resources Limited (GARL, Project Proponent or PP).

The PP is one of the leading FMCG companies in India with international presence in the edible and
non-edible oils industry. GARL is engaged in the manufacturing and exports of industrial products
viz. castor oil of various grades and its derivatives. The PP has the full ownership of the project
activity. This project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHGs, currently being
applied under the “Universal Carbon Registry” program (i.e. UCR CoU Standard), which rewards
wind power programs with carbon credits as an incentive for positive climate action in the Global
South, as opposed to carbon finance in other international voluntary carbon programs.

The generated electricity from the WTGs are connected to the state electric utility grids of Gujarat,
India. The commissioning date of the first WTG in the bundle is considered as the start date of the
project activity and is recorded as 18/07/2006.

The bundled wind power projects are operational activities with continuous reduction of GHGs,
currently being applied for voluntary carbon offset units (CoUs) under “Universal Carbon Registry”
(UCR). In the absence of the project activity, electricity would have been delivered to the grid by
the operation of fossil fuel-based grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new fossil
fuel-based generation sources in the grid.

As is the nature of wind projects (renewable energy), no fossil fuel is involved for power generation
in the project activity. The electricity produced by the project is directly contributing to climate
change mitigation by reducing the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs, i.e. CO2)
into the atmosphere by displacing an equivalent amount of power at grid. In wind energy based
power generation, the kinetic energy of the wind is being converted to mechanical energy and
subsequently to electric energy. The kinetic energy is converted into mechanical energy. The wind
blade supplies the mechanical energy to the generator thereby producing electricity.
The project activity is hence the installation of new grid connected renewable power plants/units.
The baseline scenario and scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity are
both the same.

The project activity has displaced/avoided an estimated annual net electricity generation i.e., 56377
MWh from the Indian grid system, which otherwise would have been generated by the operation of
fossil fuel-based grid-connected power plant for this 1st UCR period. The estimated CO2e emission reductions by the
project activity for this 1st UCR monitored period is 50734 tCO2e.

PRIOR HISTORY

WTGs V-05 and M-16 have been previously registered under the UNFCCC CDM as:

 Title project activity: 5 MW WIND POWER PROJECT BY GOKUL REFOILS AND SOLVENT
LIMITED

CDM Registration Date: 07 Feb 2011

CDM Reference number: 4062

Monitoring Period: 07/02/2011 - 31/01/2012

CERs issued: 5956 tCO2 (Serial Range: Block start: IN-5-175448640-1-1-0-4062 Block end: IN-5-
175454595-1-1-0-4062)
_____________________
WTGs ADO-33 has been previously registered under the UNFCCC CDM as:

 Title project activity: 2.5 MW Wind Project by Gokul Refoils & Solvent Limited

CDM Reference number: 9722

CDM Registration Date: 26 Aug 2013

No CERs have been issued till date

GARL is the de-merged entity of Gokul Refoils & Solvent Limited under which all the above CDM
projects had been registered. The project activity has not claimed voluntary/verified carbon credits
under any GHG mechanism for the period 2013-2022, hence the project activity will not cause
double accounting of carbon offset units or credits (i.e., CoUs) under the UCR CoU Program.
